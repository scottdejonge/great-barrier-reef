## You’re entitled to your opinion, unless it's not based on facts

Senator-elect Pauline Hanson, leader of the far-right 'One Nation' party secured the required number of votes in Queensland and therefore has a legitimate right to represent her party in the Senate.
 
In a free and open democracy people are entitled to their opinions, however, politicians who occupy positions of power and responsibility must rise above divisive, inflammatory, baseless and unconstitutional rhetoric.

FactCheckOneNation is about moving past the political rhetoric and divisiveness. The website seeks to illuminate the substance and veracity of One Nation's policies and position statements.

We have sought to fact check each and every one of One Nation’s policy statements on Islam and Muslims to see how they stack up. You can find the responses here 

Pauline Hanson’s One Nation Party has a host of policy positions on Islam and Muslims – in fact she has dedicated a whole section to it on her website.

We will shortly begin fact checking our way through the rest of One Nation's policies.
